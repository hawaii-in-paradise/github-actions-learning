# github-actions-learning

![Hello World Python](https://github.com/hawaii-in-paradise/github-actions-learning/actions/workflows/hello-world.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The intended purpose of this is to learn github actions.  By the end of this tutorial I would have learned how to use a github action and have a badge on my README showing a passing pipeline.

To keep things simple the first lesson will create a running pipeline that shows a hello world prompt using a python script.

Then as things progress I will be able then re-use this pipeline as a sub-module into other branches that will be able to run using the agents within this pipeline.
